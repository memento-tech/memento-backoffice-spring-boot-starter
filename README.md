### **1. Introduction**

#### **Overview of the project**
The Backoffice Spring Boot Starter is built to make backend management simple and efficient. It serves as a **developer-friendly console** that eliminates the need to work directly with the database using tools like SQL or database management software and enables employees outside of development zone to work and monitor application. By focusing on streamlining workflows, it empowers teams to manage changes and resolve issues more effectively.

#### **Key Objectives**

1.  **Simplify Backend Workflows**
    
    -   Perform common backend tasks without dealing directly with the database.
    -   Quickly identify and track changes made by the main application to the database.
2.  **Developer and QA Efficiency**
    
    -   Provide developers and QA engineers with tools to make their jobs easier and faster.
    -   Centralize backend operations to reduce dependency on external tools.
3.  **Future Growth**
    
    -   Expand to include features for **business users**, enabling them to monitor the app, analyze data, and collaborate with development teams.
    -   Remove dependency on Hibernate and implement abstract JPA solution in order to accommodate other JPA implementations like Spring Data JPA, MyBatis, EclipseLink etc.

#### **Current Features**

-   **Plug-and-Play Integration**
    -   Get started quickly with minimal setup required.
-   **Translation Support**
    -   Manage and update application translations with ease.
-   **Media Management**
    -   Upload, organize, and manage media files like images and documents.
-   **Cron Job Support**
	-  Create and run simple and complex cron jobs and monitor their health

The Backoffice Spring Boot Starter bridges the gap between development, testing, and future business needs, making it a powerful and flexible solution for managing backend operations.

### **Intended Audience**

The Backoffice Spring Boot Starter is designed for **small companies**, **startups**, and **mid-sized companies** that want to accelerate development and streamline backend operations.

-   **For Startups**:
    
    -   Perfect for new projects looking to get up and running quickly.
    -   All you need is **Spring Boot** and **Hibernate**â€”the starter takes care of the rest.
-   **For Existing Projects**:
    
    -   Easily adaptable for mid-sized or established projects.
    -   Some adjustments may be required to integrate the starter seamlessly, but these will be addressed in future sections.

Whether you're launching a new project or enhancing an existing one, the Backoffice Spring Boot Starter provides a flexible, easy-to-use solution to boost your development process.

### **Prerequisites**

Before getting started with the Backoffice Spring Boot Starter, ensure you have the following knowledge and tools:

#### **Required Knowledge**

-   **Java**: A solid understanding of Java is essential for working with the backend.
-   **Spring Boot**: Even though familiarity with Spring Boot is mandatory, it's likely already part of your toolkit if you're building a Spring Boot application.
-   **Hibernate**: Understanding Hibernate is necessary for working with the starter's database integration.
-   **ReactJS**: The frontend uses React, and you'll need knowledge of it to extend the current implementation or customize features using your code.

#### **Tools Needed**

-   **JDK**: Java Development Kit, compatible with your project's Spring Boot version.
-   **Maven or Gradle**: For dependency management and building the project.
-   **Node.js**: Required for the React frontend development and build process.

With these prerequisites in place, you're ready to integrate and start using the starter.
